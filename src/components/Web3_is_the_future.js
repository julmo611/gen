			<h2>Remember Back to the Future? Well, that's kinda like us.</h2>
			<p>
				We'll fly that DeLorean back to the 80s, and pick up digital parodies of
				your fav musicians, stars, and possibly your{' '}
				<strong>high school crush</strong>, decked out in everything from
				oversized shoulder pads to pocket protectors and rocking everything from{' '}
				<strong>mohawks to mixtapes</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we'll fast forward in time to the amazing digital world of Web3,
				where things are really happen’en.
			</p>
			<p>
				With your flight of <strong>boy band posters</strong> and maybe a{' '}
				<strong>boombox</strong> in tow, you'll open the door to a ton of
				totally tubular online and IRL edutainment events, where you’ll learn
				Web3 at your own speed, in a space with other 80s kids and pop culture
				lovers that doesn’t feel like you’re stuck in detention.
