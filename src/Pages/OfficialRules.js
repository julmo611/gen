							</strong>{' '}
							From time-to-time, Core Memories, LLC dba Gen-X NFTs (“Sponsor”)
							will present different sweepstakes and/or random drawings, each
							with separate entry pools, prizes and start and end dates (each, a
							“Random Drawing”). Entry method(s) for each Random Drawing will be
							posted and communicated by Sponsor in the call to action in
							advance of each applicable Random Drawing (which entry methods may
							include, without limitation, online submission form on a Sponsor
							website, Sponsor social media account, Sponsor Google form,
							Premint page, or other location). The end date for each Random
							Drawing and the corresponding prize(s) will be posted in the call
							to action for that Random Drawing. Prize(s) may include, without
							limitation, a non-fungible token, or “NFT,” and the
							actual/appraised prize value may differ at the time the prize is
							awarded.
						</p>

						<p>Maximum one (1) entry per person per Random Drawing.</p>

						<p>
							Information submitted with any entry is subject to the{' '}
							<a href="/Privacy-Policy">Privacy Policy</a> stated on the
							www.genxnfts.xyz website.
						</p>

						<p>
							Any Random Drawing hosted or presented by Sponsor is in no way
							sponsored, endorsed, administered by, or associated with Discord,
							Twitter, Facebook, Google, Discord, or any other third party
							media, brand, advertiser or publisher who may display advertising,
							posts, or information about the Random Drawing on their sites.
						</p>

						<p>
							By entering a Random Drawing, each entrant represents and warrants
							that (i) such entrant has read, and agree to be bound by, these
							Official Rules and any applicable policies or procedures posted by
							Sponsor or any social media platform, (ii) based on these Official
							Rules, such entrant is eligible to participate in the applicable
							Random Drawing, and (iii) all of the information provided as part
							of such entrant’s entry is accurate, does not violate any third
							party’s legal rights (including, without limitation, rights of
							privacy and publicity), and otherwise does not violate applicable
							law.

							<strong>
								<u>Eligibility</u>
							</strong>
							. Each Random Drawing is open to legal United States residents
							residing in the fifty (50) United States or the District of
							Columbia who have the legal right to consent and are eighteen (18)
							years of age or older at the time of entry. Each entry must fully
							meet all applicable Random Drawing requirements, as specified in
							these Official Rules and the applicable call to action, in order
							to be eligible to win a prize. Incomplete entries or those that do
							not adhere to the Official Rules or specifications or the
							applicable call to action will be disqualified at Sponsor’s sole
							discretion. Employees, officers, members, agents, contractors,
							partners, representatives, managers, directors, parents,
							subsidiaries, successors, assigns, and affiliated companies of
							Sponsor and/or of any company, brand and/or
							advertising/promotional agencies involved with any Random Drawing
							(collectively, the “Sweepstakes Entities”), and the immediate
							family members of, and any persons domiciled with, any Sweepstakes
							Entities, are not eligible to enter or to win. Entry into any
							Random Drawing does not carry over into any other Random Drawing.
							Any attempt by any entrant to use multiple accounts, email
							addresses, identities, or login credentials of any kind, or to
							otherwise enter more than once, or to submit false or misleading
							information, will void that entrant’s entries and shall subject
							the entrant to potential disqualification from future Random
							Drawings administered by or on behalf of Sponsor or any of the
							Sweepstakes Entities. Entries submitted by script, macro, bot or
							other automated or mechanical means, entries by any means which
							subvert the entry process and entries made in any fashion other
							than as specified herein are void. Use of any automated system to
							participate is prohibited and will result in disqualification. In
							the event of disqualification, any prize that entrant might have
							been otherwise entitled to will not be awarded. By entering a
							Random Drawing, entrants agrees to receive newsletters and other
							promotional material from the Sponsor and/or the Sweepstakes
							Entities. You may update your newsletter subscription preferences,
							and may opt-out of marketing emails altogether, upon receipt of
							any newsletter email from the Sponsor or the applicable

							about each entrant, including, without limitation, entrant’s name,
							email, social media handles, and/or wallet address. By
							participating in a Random Drawing, except as limited by law,
							entrant hereby agrees to the Sponsor’s collection and usage of

							<strong>
								<u>Winner Selection; Prize; Odds</u>
							</strong>
							. By the date that is on or about ten (10) days after the end date
							noted for each Random Drawing, the potential winner(s) will be
							selected in a random drawing, under the supervision of the
							Sponsor, from among all eligible entries received for the
							corresponding Random Drawing. If a potential winner is found
							ineligible or fails to comply with these Official Rules, that
							entrant’s claim to the applicable prize is forfeited and an
							alternate qualifying and eligible entrant may be selected, at
							Sponsor’s sole discretion. The Sweepstakes Entities are not
							responsible for and shall not be liable for late, lost, damaged,
							intercepted, misdirected, or unsuccessful efforts to notify the
							potential winner. The Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for
							electronic communications that are undeliverable or otherwise
							obscured from the intended recipient’s notice as a result of any
							form of active or passive filtering of any kind, or insufficient
							space in entrant’s email account or phone, including voicemail.
							The approximate retail value (“ARV”) of each prize awarded
							hereunder will be disclosed by Sponsor in connection with the
							applicable Random Drawing. The value of each prize represents
							Sponsor’s good faith determination of the ARV thereof and cannot
							be challenged or appealed. The applicable prize consists of only
							those items specifically listed by Sponsor as part of the prize.
							ALL PRIZES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND ON AN “AS
							AVAILABLE” BASIS. SPONSOR DOES NOT MAKE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS,
							ANY WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE
							APPLICABLE PRIZE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED OR
							STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
							PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The Sweepstakes Entities make
							no warranties, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to
							the use or enjoyment of any prize, or any portion thereof,
							including, without limitation, its quality, merchantability or
							fitness for a particular purpose. Any and all warranties for a
							prize, or any portion thereof, are contained in the manufacturers’
							or service providers’ warranties, as relevant. Odds of winning
							depend on the number of eligible entries received for each Random
							Drawing.

							<strong>
								<u>Winner Notification and Acceptance</u>
							</strong>
							. Potential winners will be notified via the email address or
							other contact information provided at time of entry and/or via
							Sponsor’s website, Discord server, Twitter account and/or other
							social media account (as determined by Sponsor in its sole
							discretion) with instructions on how to claim the applicable
							prize. Sponsor will have no liability for any potential winner
							notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a
							potential winner for any reason. If, despite reasonable efforts, a
							potential winner does not respond within twenty-four (24) hours of
							the first notification attempt, or if any prize or prize
							notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such
							potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her
							prize and an alternate winner may be selected. Sponsor, in its
							sole discretion, will attempt to contact up to three (3) potential
							winners of a prize in accordance with the above procedure, after
							which the prize in question may go unawarded if it remains
							unclaimed. The applicable prize will be awarded only if the
							Sponsor has verified that the winner has (i) complied with these
							Official Rules and (ii) completed, signed and returned to the
							Sponsor documents required by Sponsor (which may include, without
							limitation, an Affidavit, Release and W-9) within three (3) days
							of receiving the same from the Sponsor. Entrants’ personal
							information will be utilized by the Sponsor for fulfillment of the
							prize and to comply with legal requirements. To review Sponsor’s
							Privacy Policy, go to https://www.genxnfts.xyz/Privacy-Policy. If
							any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or
							she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines the
							prize for any reason prior to award, such potential prize winner
							will be disqualified and an alternate prize winner may be
							selected. Each prize is non-assignable and non-transferable. No
							substitutions allowed by winner. Each prize and any individual
							components of any prize package are subject to availability and
							Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prize(s) of equal or
							greater value at any time. Winner is solely responsible for all
							expenses related to the applicable prize, including, without
							limitation, reporting and payment of any taxes on all prizes
							(including, without limitation, federal, state and local taxes) as
							well as any other costs and expenses associated with acceptance
							and use of a prize. Winner may be issued an IRS form 1099 based on
							the actual value of the prize awarded. Failure to comply with any
							term or condition of these Official Rules, may result in a
							winner’s disqualification, the forfeiture of his or her interest
							in the prize, and the award of the prize to a substitute winner.
							Except where prohibited, acceptance of any prize constitutes
							winner’s consent to the publication of his or her name,
							biographical information and likeness in any media for any
							commercial or promotional purpose, without limitation the
							Internet, or further compensation. The winner may be asked to
							provide the Sponsor with a valid Social Security number or
							taxpayer-identification number, as well as execute additional
							documents required by Sponsor in connection with the applicable
							Random Drawing (e.g., affidavit of eligibility, W-9, release,
							etc.), before the Sponsor can award the applicable prize.

							<strong>
								<u>Disclaimers / Limitations On Liability</u>
							</strong>
							. By entering, all entrants agree that the Sweepstakes Entities
							assume no liability whatsoever for injuries or damages of any kind
							sustained in connection with the use, acceptance, possession or
							awarding of any prize or while preparing for, participating in
							and/or traveling to or from any Random Drawing-related activity,
							including, without limitation, any injury, damage, death, loss or
							accident to person or property due to an intentional act, an act
							of negligence or default and/or any act of God. By entering a
							Random Drawing, entrants agree to waive any right to claim

							not responsible for human errors or for any damaged, tampered
							with, delayed, illegible, incomplete, inaccurate, garbled, late,
							lost, forged, misaddressed, misdirected, mutilated, mass
							machine-generated, unintelligible, incomprehensible, stolen

							for any typographical errors in these Official Rules, any Random
							Drawing content or any advertising materials for any Random
							Drawing, or for any kind of computer, electronic, hardware,
							software, Internet, network, technical or telephone failures
							and/or problems caused by the Sponsor and/or the Sweepstakes

							capable of running as planned, rendered impossible of performance
							in any way or prevented, including, without limitation, because of
							any kind of computer viruses, bugs, electronic, hardware,
							software, Internet, network, technical or telephone failures,
							tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, an event of force
							majeure or any other cause created by Sponsor and/or the
							Sweepstakes Entities, the user or by any of the equipment or
							programming associated with or utilized in the Random Drawing,
							Sponsor reserves the right, at their sole discretion, to change
							the Official Rules, to cancel, modify, suspend or withdraw the
							Random Drawing or any offer and/or cancel, modify, suspend or
							withdraw any method of entry, without notice, and select prize

							8.{' '}
							<strong>
								<u>Assumption Of Risks Related To NFTs And Blockchain</u>
							</strong>
							. The prize in a Random Drawing may consist of a non-fungible
							token (NFT). There are inherent risks associated with NFTs and the
							blockchain networks on which they’re offered.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Volatility:</strong>
							<br />
							The prices of NFTs are extremely volatile and subjective. NFTs
							have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of
							other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
							value of an NFT, which may also be subject to significant price
							volatility. Sponsor does not guarantee that any NFT prize will
							obtain or retain value, as the value of NFTs is inherently
							subjective, and factors occurring outside of Sponsor’s control may
							materially impact the value and desirability of any particular
							NFT. NFT prizes are not, and should not be treated as, an
							investment asset, and are not intended for investment purposes.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Inherent Risks:</strong>
							<br />
							There are inherent risks associated with using NFTs, including,
							but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
							connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the
							risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
							information stored within an individual’s digital wallet. The
							regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
							cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
							policies may materially adversely affect the potential utility or
							value of NFTs. ACCEPTANCE OF ANY NFT PRIZE THAT YOU MAY WIN IS
							ENTIRELY AT YOUR RISK.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Use of Blockchain:</strong>
						</p>

						<p>
							NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on
							the blockchain.
						</p>

						<p>
							IF YOU WIN AN NFT PRIZE, YOU ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER
							SPONSOR NOR ANY OF THE SWEEPSTAKES ENTITIES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
							FOR ANY COMMUNICATION FAILURES, DISRUPTIONS, ERRORS, DISTORTIONS
							OR DELAYS YOU MAY EXPERIENCE WHEN USING THE APPLICABLE ONLINE
							PLATFORM OR BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK, HOWEVER CAUSED. UPGRADES TO SUCH
							PLATFORM OR BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK, OR A CHANGE IN HOW TRANSACTIONS
							ARE CONFIRMED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK MAY HAVE UNINTENDED,
							ADVERSE EFFECTS ON YOUR NFT.
						</p>

						<p>
							NFTs are intangible digital assets that exist only by virtue of
							the ownership record maintained in the applicable blockchain
							network. All smart contracts are conducted and occur on the
							decentralized ledger within the blockchain. NEITHER SPONSOR NOR
							ANY OF THE SWEEPSTAKES ENTITIES HAS ANY CONTROL OVER AND NONE OF
							THE FOREGOING MAKES ANY GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO
							SMART CONTRACTS. NEITHER SPONSOR NOR ANY OF THE SWEEPSTAKES
							ENTITIES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS, OR ANY
							ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LATE REPORT BY
							DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES
							WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR
							ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.
						</p>

						<p>
							NEITHER SPONSOR NOR ANY OF THE SWEEPSTAKES ENTITIES WILL BE
							RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE
							RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN OR YOUR ELECTRONIC WALLET,
							INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS
							ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR
							INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (II)
							SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (III) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; OR (IV)
							UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT
							NOT LIMITED TO, VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTE-FORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF
							ATTACK AGAINST THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR ANY ELECTRONIC
							WALLET.

							<strong>
								<u>General</u>
							</strong>
							. Entrants of each Random Drawing agree that the Sweepstakes
							Entities have not made any warranty, representation or guarantee
							express or implied, in fact or in law, with respect to any prize,
							including, without limitation, to such prize’s quality or fitness
							for a particular purpose, and agree that the Sweepstakes Entities
							will not be responsible or liable for, and are expressly released
							from, any and all costs, injuries, litigation, losses or damages
							of any kind or nature, including, without limitation, death and
							bodily injury, due or related in whole or in part, directly or
							indirectly, to (i) participation in any Random Drawing or any
							Random Drawing-related activity, (ii) entrants’ acceptance,
							receipt, possession and/or use or misuse of any prize, (iii) any
							type of technical failure, (iv) the unavailability or
							inaccessibility of any transmissions, phone, or Internet service,
							(v) unauthorized intervention in any part of the entry process or
							any Random Drawing, and/or (vi) electronic error or human error in
							any Random Drawing administration or the processing of entries.
							The Sweepstakes Entities assume no responsibility for any damage
							to an entrant’s or any other person’s computer system or wireless
							phone which is occasioned by participating in any Random Drawing,
							or for any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or
							program malfunctions, or other errors, failures, delayed computer
							transmissions or network connections that are human or technical
							in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
							Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for incomplete,
							misdirected, late, lost, submissions or prize notifications; or
							for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks,
							servers, satellites, Internet service providers, websites, or
							other connections; or for miscommunications, failed, jumbled,
							scrambled, delayed, or misdirected computer, telephone or cable
							transmissions; or for any technical malfunctions, failures,
							difficulties or other errors of any kind or nature; or for the
							incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to
							capture any information. The Sweepstakes Entities reserve the
							right in their sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is
							found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of
							any Random Drawing, to be acting in violation of these Official
							Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner,
							or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate
							operation of any Random Drawing, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or
							harass any other person, and the Sweepstakes Entities reserve the
							right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to
							the fullest extent permitted by law. No mechanically reproduced,
							illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other
							automated multiple entries will be accepted. Sponsor reserves the
							right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate any Random Drawing
							if it determines, in its sole discretion, that such Random Drawing
							is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical
							problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond
							Sponsor’s reasonable control have destroyed or severely undermined
							or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security,
							proper play and/or feasibility of such Random Drawing. In the
							event Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with
							any Random Drawing as contemplated herein by any event beyond its
							reasonable control, Sponsor will have the right to modify,
							suspend, or terminate the applicable Random Drawing. If any Random
							Drawing is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor will
							(if possible) select winner(s) in a random drawing from all
							eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event
							giving rise to the termination. Inclusion in such drawing will be
							each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances.
							These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way
							except in a written document issued by a duly authorized
							representative of Sponsor. The invalidity or unenforceability of
							any provision of these Official Rules will not affect the validity
							or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any
							provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable
							or illegal, these Official Rules will otherwise remain in effect
							and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the
							invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. Any
							questions regarding the number of entries or votes submitted by
							the owner of an ISP account will be determined by Sponsor in its
							sole discretion. The Sweepstakes Entities reserve the right to
							contact entrants at the email address provided by them. Entrants
							may choose to opt-out of future notifications and communications.{' '}

							<strong>
								<u>Governing Law</u>
							</strong>
							. The parties agree that each Random Drawing and these Official
							Rules will be governed, construed and interpreted under the laws
							of the State of California without giving effect to any choice of
							law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of California
							or any other jurisdiction) which would cause the application of
							the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.
							ANY ATTEMPT TO DAMAGE ANY ONLINE OR CELLULAR SERVICE OR WEBSITE OR
							UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF ANY RANDOM DRAWING VIOLATES
							CRIMINAL AND/OR CIVIL LAWS. IF SUCH AN ATTEMPT IS MADE, SPONSOR
							MAY, AT ITS SOLE AND REASONABLE DISCRETION, DISQUALIFY ANY AND ALL
							ENTRANTS MAKING SUCH ATTEMPT AND SPONSOR MAY SEEK DAMAGES
							(INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY

								Section 11(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues
								of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party
								and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
								the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
								necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
								claim. To the extent that a party prevails on a claim and seeks
								public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has
								the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
								threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
								extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of
								competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
								that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
								be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual
								claims in arbitration.
							</li>
							<li>
								(g) Class Action Waiver. EACH ENTRANT AGREES THAT EACH ENTRANT
								MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST SPONSOR OR ANY SWEEPSTAKES ENTITIES
								ONLY IN SUCH ENTRANT’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
								PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
								REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is
								resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
								another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
								preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
								If this specific provision is found to be unconscionable or
								unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
								section shall be null and void and the dispute must be brought
								in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County,
								California.
							</li>
							<li>
								(h) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in
								Section 11(g) of these Official Rules (“Class Action Waiver”),
								if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that
								any part of these Official Rules is invalid or unenforceable,
								the other parts of these Official Rules will still apply and
								remain in full force and effect, and any terms deemed invalid or
								unenforceable shall be enforced to the maximum extent
								permissible and otherwise shall be modified by such arbitrator
								or court, consistent with the original intent of the parties
								here, to the limited extent necessary to cause such terms to be
								valid and enforceable.
