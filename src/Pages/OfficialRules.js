							unclaimed. If any potential prize winner is found to be
							ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official
							Rules or declines the prize for any reason prior to award, such
							potential prize winner will be disqualified and an alternate prize
							winner may be selected. Each prize is non-assignable and
							non-transferable. No substitutions allowed by winner. Each prize
							and any individual components of any prize package are subject to
							availability and Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prize(s)
							of equal or greater value at any time. Winner is solely
							responsible for all expenses related to the applicable prize,
							including, without limitation, reporting and payment of any taxes
							on all prizes. Failure to comply with any term or condition of
							these Official Rules, may result in a winner’s disqualification,
							the forfeiture of his or her interest in the prize, and the award
							of the prize to a substitute winner. Except where prohibited,
							acceptance of any prize constitutes winner’s consent to the
							publication of his or her name, biographical information and
							likeness in any media for any commercial or promotional purpose,
