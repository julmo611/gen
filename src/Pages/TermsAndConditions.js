							12. <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								(a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER THE CM
								PARTIES NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED
								IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITE WILL BE LIABLE
								WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF, OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO
								OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT,
								NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY
								FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR
								CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST
								REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA
								OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM
								FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING
								OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR
								INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
								TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER
								LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CM PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR
								RESPECTIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
								POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH
								HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
							</li>
							<li>
								(b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE
								CM PARTIES TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
								THESE TERMS, THE AGREEMENT, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
								USE THE SITE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).
							</li>
							<li>
								(c) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ANY OF THE CM PARTIES BE
								REQUIRED TO DELIVER TO YOU ANY VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR NFTS AS
								DAMAGES, MAKE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, OR ANY OTHER REMEDY. IF YOU
								WOULD BASE YOUR CALCULATIONS OF DAMAGES IN ANY WAY ON THE VALUE
								OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR NFTS, YOU AGREE THAT THE CALCULATION
								SHALL BE BASED ON THE LOWEST VALUE OF THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR
								NFTS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE INITIAL INCIDENT RESULTING IN
								THE ACCRUAL OF THE CLAIM AND THE AWARD OF DAMAGES.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								(d) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE
								ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN CM
								AND YOU.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								(e) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE INTENDED TO APPLY
								TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WITHOUT
								REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OR THE
								AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE BEEN PROVEN INEFFECTIVE.
								SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
								CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIABILITIES PROVIDED HEREIN, SO SOME OF
								THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS HEREIN MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO
								THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMER OF
								WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN, THE
								SCOPE OF SUCH WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL BE AS
								PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							13. <strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms
							and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S.
							Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of
							the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
							provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 14
							“Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes
							(defined below) that you and the CM Parties are not required to
							arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the
							State of California, and you and CM each waive any objection to
							jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
						</p>

						<p>
							14. <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION
							CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS,
							INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY
							HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING
							ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								(a) Informal Resolution of Disputes. You and CM must first
								attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
								of or relating to these Terms, the Agreement, or the breach,
								termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or
								the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) informally.
								Accordingly, neither you nor CM may start a formal arbitration
								proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies
								the other party of a claim in writing. As part of this informal
								resolution process, you must deliver your written notices via
								first-class mail to us at Core Memories, LLC, 8 The Green, STE
								B, Dover, DE 19901.
							</li>
							<li>
								(b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY
								DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
								ARBITRATION AND NOT IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED
								ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU AND CM AGREE THAT THE U.S. FEDERAL
								ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF
								THESE TERMS, AND THAT YOU AND CM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
								TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. THIS
								ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.
								IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND REVIEW IS LIMITED.
								THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION AND AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING, WITH
								LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN
								ANY COURT WITH JURISDICTION.
							</li>
							<li>
								(c) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 14(b) above:
								(i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court
								in Los Angeles County, California if it qualifies; and (ii) we
								each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
								relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
								misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								(d) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The
								arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
								Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the
								“AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
								The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
								1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must
								submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice
								to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
								provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any
								arbitration hearings will take place in Los Angeles County,
								California, unless we both agree to a different location. The
								parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority
								to decide all issues relating to the interpretation,
								applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration
								agreement. If an in-person hearing is required, then it will
								take place in Los Angeles, California. The federal or state law
								that applies to these Terms will also apply during the
								arbitration.{' '}
							</li>
							<li>
								(e) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
								arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. The party
								prevailing in arbitration will be entitled to an award of
								attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses to the extent provided under
								applicable law.
							</li>
							<li>
								(f) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in
								Section 14(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues
								of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party
								and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of
								the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
								necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
								claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek
								public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has
								the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
								threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
								extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of
								competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
								that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
								be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual
								claims in arbitration.
							</li>
							<li>
								(g) Class Action Waiver. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS
								AGAINST THE CM PARTIES ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
								AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
								REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is
								resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
								another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
								preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
								If this specific provision is found to be unconscionable or
								unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution
								section shall be null and void and the dispute must be brought
								in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County,
								California.
							</li>
							<li>
								(h) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in
								Section 14(g) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an
								arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any
								part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts
								of these Terms will still apply and remain in full force and
								effect, and any terms deemed invalid or unenforceable shall be
								enforced to the maximum extent permissible and otherwise shall
								be modified by such arbitrator or court, consistent with the
								original intent of the parties here, to the limited extent
								necessary to cause such terms to be valid and enforceable.
							</li>
						</ul>
