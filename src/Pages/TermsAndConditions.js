						</p>
						<p>
							You represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or

								<u>
									NFT Transactions; Linking Your Digital / Cryptocurrency Wallet
								</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							When each NFT is sold for the first time, the agreement for sale
							is between Company and the initial purchaser. There can be several
							different owners of each NFT throughout time (e.g., the initial
							purchaser and subsequent legitimate owners, through resales of the
							NFT), but only ever one owner at a time. An owner of an NFT is one
							who has purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired the NFT from a
							legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the
							relevant blockchain.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are solely responsible for your Digital Wallet security,
							including associated passwords, seed words, and keys. Company
							shall not, in any event whatsoever, be held responsible for any
							risk associated with your access and/or use of a Digital Wallet.
							In the event you lose or can no longer access your Digital Wallet,
							Company cannot retrieve your NFT from your Digital Wallet.
						</p>
						<p>
							If an initial purchaser of an NFT decides to sell the NFT through
							this Site and the Site provides such functionality, then this Site
							serves only as a platform that facilitates transactions between a
							buyer and a seller and neither Company is not a party to any
							agreement between such buyer and seller of any NFTs or between any
							other users.
						</p>
						<p>
							All NFTs are stored on and accessible through a cryptographic and
							blockchain-based system, such as Ethereum blockchain. As such,
							Company does not maintain the NFTs on this Site and, aside from
							potentially transferring control of the NFT to the initial
							purchaser of the NFT, if applicable, Company has no control over
							the transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							{' '}
							you connect your Digital Wallet to the Site using a service
							provider such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect, as applicable, you
							accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and all of
							the terms incorporated herein by reference.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Site may give you access to pre-sales and/or primary sales of
							the NFTs through one or several of the following access rights:
							free mint for holders of NFTs, allow list, pre-sale, premint,
							and/or public sale. If applicable, you will be required to connect
							your Digital Wallet to the Site in order to, depending on the
							rights you have been granted in connection with the pre-sale
							and/or primary public sale, (i) where applicable, confirm your
							current ownership of an NFT or confirm your Digital Wallet was
							selected and approved to be on any pre-sale list, allow list, or
							pre-mint list, and/or (ii) transfer to Company the applicable
							purchase price, and (iii) receive the NFT you acquired.
						</p>
						<p>
							If applicable, the purchase price of the NFTs will be set forth on
							Site and are binding at the time of purchase. All sales are made
							in Ethereum (ETH) or other cryptocurrency as set forth on the
							Site. Additional fees (including gas fees) may be required at the
							time of purchase to complete the sale. Company does not monitor
							nor benefit from these fees, and you shall be solely responsible
							for payment of such fees in order to purchase any NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							If applicable, Company will directly transfer the NFT you acquired
							to the supported Digital Wallet you connected to Site, depending
							the case and where applicable, upon confirmation of ownership of
							an NFT, confirmation that your Digital Wallet was selected and
							approved to be on any pre-sale list, allow list, or premint list,
							and/or upon receipt of the corresponding purchase price.
						</p>
						<p>
							All sales, if any, completed on the Site are final. Pursuant to
							applicable law, you acknowledge that no withdrawal, return and/or
							refund rights may apply. Once an NFT has been successfully sold
							and transferred, it may not be returned and the payment and any
							associated transaction (i.e., gas fees) costs will not be
							refunded.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you link your Digital Wallet, you understand and agree that
							you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your
							wallet and your control over any wallet-related authentication
							credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible
							tokens or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible
							through your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your
							cryptocurrency wallet by third parties could result in the loss or
							theft of NFTs, cryptocurrency, and/or funds held in your wallet
							and any associated wallets, including, without limitation, any
							linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit
							card(s). We are not responsible for managing and maintaining the
							security of your cryptocurrency wallet nor for any unauthorized
							access to or use of your cryptocurrency wallet. If you notice any
							unauthorized or suspicious activity in your Digital Wallet that
							seems to be related to this Site, please notify us immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unless stated otherwise, when you mint or purchase any NFT(s)
							through our Services, if ever, you are NOT buying a specific NFT,
							Artwork, or digital work. Rather, your purchase confers on you the
							right to receive, as applicable, one or more of the NFTs from the
							collection, the specific digital work, including the artwork and
							traits, of which will be randomly assigned to each NFT based on an
							algorithm and revealed following the purchase on a date to be
							announced on the Site or other channel operated by Company.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							You must have enough funds in your Digital Wallet to cover the
							total cost of your intended NFT purchase, including gas and any
							other applicable fees. All pricing and payment terms will be as
							indicated at point of sale or otherwise on the Site or applicable
							website or platform, and any payment obligations you incur are
							binding at the time of purchase. You may not substitute any other
							currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the
							currency in which you have contracted to pay at the time of
							purchase. For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any
							currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise, or applicable gas
							or other fees shall impact or excuse your obligations with respect
							to any purchase. Each NFT will be transferred to the Digital
							Wallet of the buyer of the NFT, and the transaction will be
							completed in accordance with these Terms and/or the applicable
							terms of the applicable website or platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any transactions initiated through our site are effected by
							third-party digital wallet applications, websites, platforms,
							and/or extensions (each, an “Extension”). By using the site and
							our services, you agree that such transactions are governed by the
							terms of services and privacy policy for the applicable extensions
							(e.g., Metamask).
						</p>
						<p>
							Please be aware that malicious third parties may offer for sale
							non-fungible tokens or other items counterfeiting the NFTs and/or
							falsely act as affiliated to or endorsed by Company. In case of
							doubt, please contact Company at signupgenxnfts@gmail.com.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your interactions with these third parties at are your own risks
							and discretion. Company is not responsible, in any way whatsoever,
							for any act or omission of said malicious third parties nor any
							adverse consequence to your interactions with them.

						<p>Commercial License</p>
						<p>
							Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Company
							grants each verifiable, legitimate owner of an NFT a limited,
							revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable,
							non-sublicensable, “as-is”, worldwide, royalty-free license to
							use, copy, and display the purchased Artwork for your NFT for the
							purpose of creating non-digital derivative works based upon the
							Artwork for commercial purposes (“Commercial Use”), but expressly
							excluding any rights or license in or to any other NFT, any Site
							Content and/or any intellectual property of Company. Examples of
							such Commercial Use would be the use of the Artwork to produce and
							sell merchandise products (e.g., hats, T-Shirts, etc.) displaying
							copies of the Artwork. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Commercial
							Use does not (a) include any form of collaboration or involvement
							of any brand or other third party, or (b) permit or result in you
							earning more than USD$100,000 in gross revenue. In the event your
							Commercial Use exceeds USD$100,000, or you expect that the gross
							revenue from your Commercial Use will exceed $100,000 USD, you
							will need to enter into a separate written commercial license with
							Company in form and substance satisfactory to Company in order to
							continue the Commercial Use (which will be in Company’s sole and
							absolute discretion) (a “Separate Commercial License”). If you
							exceed the USD$100,000 limitation, or you expect that the gross
							revenue from your Commercial Use will exceed $100,000 USD, you
							will be in breach of these Terms, and must contact Company
							immediately via email to signupgenxnfts@gmail.com regarding
							entering into a Separate Commercial License. Without entering into
							a Separate Commercial License with Company, you acknowledge and
							agree that: (x) you are in breach of these Terms; (y) in addition
							to any remedies that may be available to Company at law or in
							equity, Company may immediately terminate the licenses granted
							above; and (z) you will be liable and responsible to reimburse
							Company for any costs and expenses incurred by Company during the
							course of enforcing these Terms against you (including attorney
							and legal fees).
						</p>
						<p>
							You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or
							attempt to do any of the foregoing without Company’s express prior
							written consent in each case: (i) modify the Artwork for your NFT
							in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs,
							drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the Artwork for
							your NFT to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or
							service; (iii) use the Artwork for your NFT in connection with
							images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred,
							intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could
							reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise
							infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Artwork for your
							NFT in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the
							limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms
							or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell,
							distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation,
							giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or
							otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or
							consists of the Artwork for your NFT, except as expressly
							permitted in these Terms; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or
							otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to
							the Artwork for your NFT; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Artwork
							for your NFT for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.

						<p>
							To the extent that Artwork associated with your NFT contains
							intellectual property of any third party (e.g., licensed
							intellectual property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public
							figure) (“Third Party IP”), you understand and agree as follows:
							(w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in
							any way except as incorporated in the Artwork, and subject to the
							license and restrictions contained herein; (x) that the Commercial
							Use license in Section 5 above will not apply; (y) that, depending
							on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third
							Party IP, Company may need to pass through additional restrictions
							on your ability to use the Artwork; and (z) to the extent that
							Company informs you of such additional restrictions in writing
							(email being acceptable), you will be responsible for complying
							with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the
							notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this
							license.

							FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND A
							VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS TO USE ANY ARTWORK OR NFT IN ORDER TO

							<strong>
								10. <u>Risks</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							Please note the following risks in accessing, purchasing, selling
							or using NFTs: The price and liquidity of blockchain assets,
							including NFTs, are extremely volatile and may be subject to large
							fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets
							could materially and adversely affect NFTs, which may also be
							subject to significant price volatility. Legislative and
							regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or
							international level may adversely affect the use, transfer,
							exchange, and value of NFTs. NFTs are not legal tender and are not
							backed by any government. Transactions in NFTs may be
							irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
							accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions
							in NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
							ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you
							initiated the transaction. The value of NFTs may be derived from
							the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat
							currency or digital assets for NFTs, which may result in the
							potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular
							NFT should the market for that NFT disappear. Smart Contracts have
							inherent risks.
						</p>
						<p>
							You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for
							determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and
							appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not
							give advice or recommendations regarding NFTs, including the
							suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for,
							NFTs. You agree and understand that you access and use this Site,
							and/or purchase any NFT, at your own risk; however, this brief
							statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with NFTs
							and other digital assets. You agree and understand that we will
							not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
							errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using NFTs,
							however caused.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are solely responsible for your compliance with applicable
							laws and regulations, including tax obligations in relation with
							any NFT and cryptocurrencies. Please be aware that changes in
							applicable laws and regulations may impact the Services and your
							rights and obligations regarding your NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							By accessing and using the Site, you represent that you are
							financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
							inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
							blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of
							the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as Ethereum
							(ETH), and other digital tokens. In particular, you understand
							that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible. You further
							understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly
							volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption,
							speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge
							and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with
							cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, such as Ethereum, are
							variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further
							acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose
							some or all of their value while they are supplied through the
							Site, you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of
							tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool, and, especially in
							expert modes, experience significant price slippage and cost. You
							understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions
							of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent
							projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may
							mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge
							that Company is not responsible for any of these variables or
							risks, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you
							experience while accessing or using the Site or purchasing any
							NFT. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full
							responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the
							Site in any manner.

							NFTS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF
							THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN A SEPARATE NETWORK OR

							<strong>
								15. <u>Disputes and Arbitration Agreement</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							Carefully read the following arbitration agreement ("Arbitration
							Agreement"). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Company
							and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Company.
						</p>
						<p>
							Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute
							or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to
							any Services sold or distributed through the Site, including NFTs,
							or to any aspect of your relationship with Company will be
							resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that
							(1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
							qualify; and (2) you or Company may seek equitable relief in court
							for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights
							(such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
							copyrights, and patents).
						</p>

						<p>
							Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs
							the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
							To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
							requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered
							agent CT Corporation, 1209 N Orange St., Wilmington, Delaware,
							19801. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
							alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims
							and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees
							and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of
							the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at
							http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other
							claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
							Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
							http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s
							rules are also available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at
							800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties
							will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds
							that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative,
							hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS,
							Company shall have the option, exercisable in its sole discretion,
							to pay them for you. You may choose to have the arbitration
							conducted by telephone or video conference or based on written
							submissions, or you may request to meet in-person for arbitration
							in Los Angeles, California. You agree that any judgment on the
							award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
							competent jurisdiction.
						</p>

						<p>
							Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive
							authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this
							Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the
							interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
							Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that
							all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
							The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
							you and Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be
							consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
							or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
							monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
							available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral
							forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration
							Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
							statement of decision describing the essential findings and
							conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
							of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
							award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
							would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
							you and Company. And you agree that to the extent monetary or
							non-monetary remedy or relief is granted, such request for relief
							may be enforced as needed by any court of competent jurisdiction.
						</p>

						<p>
							<i>Waiver of Jury Trial.</i> YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY
							CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
							TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Company are instead
							electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
							arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as otherwise
							indicated in this Section 15. An arbitrator can award on an
							individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must
							follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there
							is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
							arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
						</p>

						<p>
							<i>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</i> ALL
							CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
							MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A OR
							COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND
							CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
							CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. YOU HEREBY
							EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS
							OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS
							ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE. If a decision is
							issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any
							part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for
							relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and
							brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of
							California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
						</p>

						<p>
							<i>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</i> You have the right to opt out of
							the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written
							notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: The
							Dream Factory, LLC, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801,
							Attention Legal Department, within 30 days after first becoming
							subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You may also submit your
							decision to signupgenxnfts@gmail.com. Your notice must include
							your name and address, the Digital Wallet address you used to
							transact on this Site (if you have one), and an unequivocal
							statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
							If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of
							this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this
							Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration
							agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the
							future, with Company.

							(including, without limitation, the Arbitration Agreement) are
							found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such

							Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, Attention Legal Department.

						<p>
							<strong>
								19. <u>Severability</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid

							enforceability of any remaining part of that term, cause, or
							provision, or any other terms, clause, or provision of these
							Terms.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>
								20. <u>Entire Agreement</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							These Terms comprise the entire agreement between you and Company
							relating to your access to and use of the Site, Site Content and
							any NFTs you purchase at any time, and supersede any and all prior
							discussions agreements, and understandings of any kind. Except as
							otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the
							benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party
							beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
