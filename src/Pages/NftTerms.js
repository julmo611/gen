							TO BUY AND/OR EXCHANGE DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES OR NON-FUNGIBLE
							TOKENS. USERS ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND
							MANAGEMENT OF THEIR OWN PRIVATE DIGITAL WALLET(S) AND VALIDATING
							ALL TRANSACTIONS AND CONTRACTS GENERATED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,

							NFT’S SMART CONTRACT(S) RUN ON A CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORK AND/OR

							AND IMPROVEMENTS TO SITE AND SERVICES THAT IT DEEMS NECESSARY AT
							ANY TIME.
						</p>
						<p>
							1. <u>Reviewing and Accepting These Terms</u>
							<br />
							Please read these Terms carefully, as they set out your rights and
							responsibilities when you access and/or use this Site for any
							purpose, including, without limitation, functionalities, features
							and services related to the NFTs (such as buying NFTs) and related
							community, or otherwise when you own, hold, purchase, access,
							sell, trade, swap, use, distribute, display, and/or attempt to
							acquire any NFTs or participate in any Utility (collectively, the
							“<strong>Services</strong>”).{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							You represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or
							trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental
							authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or
							restricted parties (including but not limited to the list
							maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.
							Department of the Treasury), (b) a citizen, resident, or organized
							in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of
							comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic
							sanctions by the United States, and (c) your access and use of the
							Site and/or any NFT and/or any Utility will fully comply with all
							applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or
							use the Site or any NFT or participate in any Utility to conduct,
							promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Access to some Services may only be available to holders of NFTs
							and require proof of ownership by connecting a supported
							blockchain-based digital wallet to the Site (“
							<strong>Digital Wallet</strong>”). Digital Wallets are third-party
							products and services that are not affiliated, in any way
							whatsoever, with Company, nor in its custody or control. Access
							and use of Digital Wallets, and any applications, websites,
							platforms, and extensions you may interact with in any manner, are
							at your own risk and discretion and subject to their own
							applicable terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							We reserve the right to change or modify these Terms at any time
							and in our sole discretion. You agree and understand that by
							accessing or using the Site following any change to these Terms,
							you are agreeing to the revised Terms and all of the terms
							incorporated therein by reference.
						</p>
						<p>
							IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE
							SITE.
						</p>
						<p>
							2. <u>NFT Transactions; Linking Your Digital Wallet</u>
							<br />
							When each NFT is sold for the first time, the agreement for sale
							is between Company and the initial purchaser. There can be several
							different owners of each NFT throughout time (e.g., the initial
							purchaser and subsequent legitimate owners, through resales of the
							NFT), but only ever one owner at a time. An owner of an NFT is one
							who has purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired the NFT from a
							legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the
							relevant blockchain.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are solely responsible for your Digital Wallet security,
							including associated passwords, seed words, seed phrases, and
							keys. The Company Parties shall not, in any event whatsoever, be
							held responsible for any risk associated with your access and/or
							use of a Digital Wallet. In the event you lose or can no longer
							access your Digital Wallet, Company cannot retrieve your NFT from
							your Digital Wallet and you may not be able to participate in any
							Utility.
						</p>
						<p>
							If an initial purchaser of an NFT decides to sell the NFT through
							this Site and the Site provides such functionality, then this Site
							serves only as a platform that facilitates transactions between a
							buyer and a seller and none of the Company Parties is a party to
							any agreement between such buyer and seller of any NFTs or between
							any other users.
						</p>
						<p>
							All NFTs are stored on and accessible through a cryptographic and
							blockchain-based system, such as Ethereum blockchain. As such,
							Company does not maintain the NFTs on this Site and, aside from
							potentially transferring control of the NFT to the initial
							purchaser of the NFT, if applicable, Company has no control over
							the transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you connect your Digital Wallet to the Site using a service
							provider such as MetaMask or Wallet Connect, as applicable, you
							accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and all of
							the terms incorporated herein by reference (including, without
							limitation, applicable terms of such service providers).{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							The Site may give you access to pre-sales and/or primary sales of
							the NFTs through one or several of the following access rights:
							free mint for holders of NFTs, allow list, pre-sale, Premint,
							and/or public sale.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							If applicable, you will be required to connect your Digital Wallet
							to the Site in order to, depending on the rights you have been
							granted in connection with the pre-sale and/or primary public
							sale, (i) where applicable, confirm your current ownership of an
							NFT or confirm your Digital Wallet was selected and approved to be
							on any pre-sale list, allow list, or Premint list, and/or (ii)
							transfer to Company the applicable purchase price, and/or (iii)
							receive the NFT you acquired or purchased.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							If applicable, the purchase price of the NFTs will be set forth on
							Site and are binding at the time of purchase. All sales are made
							in Ethereum (ETH) or other cryptocurrency as set forth on the
							Site. Additional fees (including gas fees or credit card
							processing fees) may be required at the time of purchase to
							complete the sale. Company does not monitor nor benefit from these
							fees, and you shall be solely responsible for payment of such fees
							in order to purchase any NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							If applicable, Company will directly transfer the NFT you acquired
							to the supported Digital Wallet you connected to Site, depending
							the case and where applicable, upon confirmation of ownership of
							an NFT, confirmation that your Digital Wallet was selected and
							approved to be on any pre-sale list, allow list, or Premint list,
							and/or upon receipt of the corresponding purchase price.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							All sales, if any, completed on the Site are final. Pursuant to
							applicable law, you acknowledge that no withdrawal, return and/or
							refund rights may apply. Once an NFT has been successfully sold
							and transferred, it may not be returned and the payment and any
							associated transaction costs (i.e., gas fees and/or credit card
							processing fees) will not be refunded.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you link your Digital Wallet, you understand and agree that
							you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your
							Digital Wallet and your control over any Digital Wallet-related
							authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys,
							non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are
							accessible through your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your
							Digital Wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft
							of NFTs, cryptocurrency, and/or funds held in your Digital Wallet
							and any associated wallets, including, without limitation, any
							linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit
							card(s). We are not responsible for managing and maintaining the
							security of your Digital Wallet nor for any unauthorized access to
							or use of your Digital Wallet. If you notice any unauthorized or
							suspicious activity in your Digital Wallet that seems to be
							related to this Site, please notify us immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unless stated otherwise, when you mint or purchase any NFT(s)
							through our Services, if ever, you are NOT buying a specific or
							pre-identified NFT, Artwork (as defined below), or digital work.
							Rather, your purchase confers on you the right to receive, as
							applicable, one or more of the NFTs from the collection, the
							specific digital work, including the Artwork and traits, of which
							will be randomly assigned to each NFT based on an algorithm and
							then your NFT(s) will be revealed following the purchase on a date
							to be announced on the Site or other channel operated by Company.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							You must have enough funds in your Digital Wallet to cover the
							total cost of your intended NFT purchase, including gas and any
							other applicable fees. All pricing and payment terms will be as
							indicated at point of sale or otherwise on the Site or applicable
							website or platform, and any payment obligations you incur are
							binding at the time of purchase. You may not substitute any other
							currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the
							currency in which you have contracted to pay at the time of
							purchase. For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any
							currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise, or applicable gas
							or other fees shall impact or excuse your obligations with respect
							to any purchase. Each NFT will be transferred to the Digital
							Wallet of the buyer of the NFT, and the transaction will be
							completed in accordance with these Terms and/or the applicable
							terms of the applicable website or platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any transactions initiated through our Site are effected by
							third-party digital wallet applications, websites, platforms,
							and/or extensions (each, an “<strong>Extension</strong>”). By
							using the Site and our Services, you agree that such transactions
							are governed by the terms of services and privacy policy for the
							applicable extensions (e.g., Metamask).
						</p>
						<p>
							Please be aware that malicious third parties may offer for sale
							non-fungible tokens or other items counterfeiting the NFTs and/or
							falsely act as affiliated to or endorsed by Company. In case of
							doubt, please contact Company at signupgenxnfts@gmail.com.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your interactions with these third parties at are your own risks
							and discretion. Company is not responsible, in any way whatsoever,
							for any act or omission of said malicious third parties nor any
							adverse consequence to your interactions with them.
						</p>
						<p>
							By owning, holding, purchasing, accessing, selling, trading,
							swapping, using, distributing, displaying, acquiring, and/or
							attempting to acquire any NFT, you expressly agree and understand
							you are accepting and undertaking the risk that any data, Artwork,
							or media associated with an NFT may at any time become unavailable
							or decoupled from an NFT (including, without limitation, because
							of an outage, downtime, data loss, pursuant to a valid DMCA
							takedown procedure, failure, obsolescence, removal, termination or
							other disruption relating to the servers upon which the Artwork
							are stored or the NFT platform) and that Company is not liable for
							any inability for you to access any such data, Artwork or media
							for any reason.
						</p>
						<p>
							You represent and warrant that you shall only acquire an NFT, if
							any, for your personal use and enjoyment, and do not have any
							expectation of profit or other income or value including, without
							limitation, from the resale of any NFT, arising from, relating to,
							or in connection therewith. The value of digital assets and
							artwork is subjective. Digital assets, including NFTs, and
							Artwork, have no inherent value. As a result, their market prices
							can be volatile. By purchasing or otherwise using any NFT, you
							agree to assume all risks associated therewith, including the risk
							that the NFT loses any or all of its value.
						</p>
						<p>
							You represent and warrant that you are sophisticated, experienced,
							and knowledgeable in the minting, bidding on, buying, or selling
							of NFTs and any Utility, as applicable. Additionally, you have
							conducted an independent investigation of the Services and the
							NFTs and the matters contemplated by these Terms, have formed your
							own independent judgment regarding the benefits and risks of and
							necessary and desirable practices regarding the foregoing, and, in
							making the determination to mint, bid on, buy, or sell any NFTs
							and any Utility using the Services, you have relied solely on the
							results of such investigation and such independent judgment.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you understand,
							acknowledge, and agree that the legal requirements pertaining to
							blockchain technologies and digital assets generally, including,
							without limitation, the NFTs, are uncertain, and you have
							conducted an independent investigation of such potentially
							applicable legal requirements and the resulting risks and
							uncertainties, including the risk that one or more governmental
							entities or other persons may assert that any digital assets or
							cryptographic tokens (including the NFTs) may constitute
							securities under applicable legal requirements. You hereby
							irrevocably disclaim and disavow reliance upon any statements or
							representations made by or on behalf of, or information made
							available by, the Company Parties, in determining to enter into
							these Terms, mint, bid on, buy, use, or sell any Utility, NFT or
							to use the Services.

							<u>
								Terms of NFT Purchase; Royalties; Secondary Sales of NFTs on
								Third-Party Platforms; Utility
							</u>
							<br />
							By owning, holding, purchasing, accessing, selling, trading,
							swapping, using, distributing, displaying, and/or attempting to
							acquire in any way whatsoever any NFT, you are deemed to have read
							and agreed to abide to these Terms in full.
						</p>
						<p>
							By placing an order to purchase an NFT on the Site or otherwise,
							you agree that you are submitting a binding offer to purchase an
							NFT or other Service. If you are the initial purchaser of a NFT or
							you are purchasing a Service, then all amounts due are to be paid
							to Company or the applicable third party. If you are not the
							initial purchaser of a NFT, then amounts may be paid to the-then
							holder of the NFT.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							You also acknowledge and agree that Company receives 10% of the
							purchase price of every subsequent sale of each NFT (“Royalties”).
							For example, if you are the initial purchaser, and you sell an NFT
							for $1,000 to a subsequent purchaser, $100 will automatically be
							transferred to Company and you will receive $900. Company has the
							right collect Royalties for NFT sales in perpetuity in any and all
							manner and on any and all applicable platforms, and may use those
							funds in any manner Company sees fit. Your payment of any and all
							applicable Royalties is a condition precedent to your and any
							subsequent NFT Owner’s right to receive any Utility in connection
							with the applicable NFT, including, without limitation, any and
							all rights or licenses granted in these Terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								<u>
									As such, if you sell a NFT on any third-party NFT marketplace,
									you agree to include a statement substantially similar to the
									following in the description of the NFT:
								</u>
							</strong>
							<br />
							“10% Royalty Applies. See Gen-X NFTs’ NFT Terms located at
							www.genxnfts.xyz for details.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Sale of an NFT on a third-party exchange or marketplace that does
							not honor and collect the Royalties is strictly prohibited, and
							the applicable Owner of an NFT acquired through a sale that does
							not comply with these Terms shall not be entitled to receive any
							Utility, including, without limitation, any and all rights or
							licenses granted in these Terms, unless and until the applicable
							Royalties due from such sale is paid to Company. In addition to
							all other rights and remedies afforded by law and equity, Company
							shall be entitled to recover from any selling Owner of an NFT who
							violates this provision all costs, including reasonable attorney’s
							fees, that Company expends to enforce its right to collect the
							Royalties from the selling Owner of an NFT. For the sake of
							clarity, the term “sale” includes any transfer to a third party
							for value or other consideration.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, when you buy or sell a NFT on this Site or otherwise,
							you agree to pay all applicable fees associated with the
							transaction and you authorize Company or the applicable third
							party to automatically charge and collect such fees from your
							payment (which may include, without limitation, credit card
							processing fees). We will endeavor to display a breakdown of any
							transaction or other fees prior to your purchase or sale of an
							NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							No refunds are permitted except with respect to any statutory
							warranties or guaranties that cannot be excluded or limited by
							law.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may resell, swap, trade, convey, and/or purchase NFTs on
							third-party platforms as part of secondary sales, subject to these
							Terms and the applicable terms and conditions of such platforms.
							Platforms dedicated to secondary sales are third-party services
							that are not affiliated with Company and which access and use are
							at user’s own risk and discretion and subject to their own
							applicable terms. Company may benefit from a percentage of the
							resale price of each NFT as the Royalty, as set forth on the Site
							and in these Terms, and subject to the third-party platform’s
							policy on which the resale is completed.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							You undertake to only resell, swap, trade, convey, and/or purchase
							NFTs ONLY on third-party platforms that (i) cryptographically
							verify each NFT owner’s rights to display and list an NFT for
							sale, to ensure that only the actual owner of this NFT can proceed
							with its resale, and (ii) provide for a percentage of the resale
							price to be automatically granted and paid directly to Company
							upon each resale.
						</p>
						<p>
							By reselling, swapping, trading, conveying, and/or purchasing an
							NFT on an authorized third-party platform, you agree to abide by
							these Terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							From time to time at their discretion, Company or third parties
							may offer NFT Owners different rights, benefits, entitlements,
							privileges, perks, experiences, events, access, opportunities,
							roles, content, products, services, resources, free items, or
							other utility (collectively, “Utility”), but these Terms do not
							confer any Utility except as expressly granted and stated in
							writing herein. The Company Parties make no assurances of any
							Utility, and any Utility offered to owners by any of the Company
							Parties, if any, shall be in the Company Parties’ sole and
							absolute discretion. The Company Parties reserve the right to deny
							or revoke Utility to any NFT owner that any of the Company Parties
							determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, is acting
							contrary to the values of Company’s community or otherwise in bad
							faith.
						</p>
						<p>
							The terms and conditions applicable to any Utility will be set
							forth in the information or materials provided with the Utility.
							Except to the extent set forth in such information or materials
							which shall supersede and govern over any conflicting or
							inconsistent provisions in these Terms, any digital works of
							authorship made available by Company as Utility (e.g., airdrops,
							free NFTs, etc.) will be licensed on the same terms set forth
							herein for, and will otherwise be treated as, NFTs. Any physical
							item provided as any Utility is not part of the NFTs and, except
							as otherwise provided in any separate terms and conditions
							applicable to the Utility, you will not have any license rights
							under any intellectual property rights in or to any such physical
							item. Unless otherwise agreed pursuant to a binding agreement
							between you and the provider of any applicable Utility, any
							Utility may be suspended or terminated at any time for any or no
							reason, including, without limitation, upon transfer by you of the
							applicable NFT or termination of any rights granted to you under
							these Terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							To the extent any third party offers any Utility in connection
							with any NFTs or subjects the same to additional terms and
							conditions (collectively, “Third-Party Terms”), you understand and
							agree that the Company Parties shall not be a party to or have any
							responsibility or liability whatsoever for, arising out of,
							relating to, or in connection with such Utility or Third-Party
							Terms.

							apply to your transactions or participation of any kind or nature
							related to the NFTs or the Utility, and to withhold, collect,
							report and remit the correct amounts of Taxes to the appropriate
							taxing authorities. Unless otherwise indicated on an applicable

							10. <u>Risks</u>
							<br />
							Please note the following risks in accessing, purchasing, selling
							or using NFTs: The price and liquidity of blockchain assets,
							including NFTs, are extremely volatile and may be subject to large
							fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets
							could materially and adversely affect NFTs, which may also be
							subject to significant price volatility. Legislative and
							regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or
							international level may adversely affect the use, transfer,
							exchange, and value of NFTs. NFTs are not legal tender and are not
							backed by any government. Transactions in NFTs may be
							irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
							accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions
							in NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
							ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you
							initiated the transaction. The value of NFTs may be derived from
							the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat
							currency or digital assets for NFTs, which may result in the
							potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular
							NFT should the market for that NFT disappear. Smart Contracts have
							inherent risks.
						</p>
						<p>
							You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for
							determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and
							appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not
							give advice or recommendations regarding NFTs, including the
							suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for,
							NFTs. You agree and understand that you access and use this Site,
							and/or purchase any NFT, at your own risk; however, this brief
							statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with NFTs
							and other digital assets. You agree and understand that we will
							not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
							errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using NFTs,
							however caused. You acknowledge and understand that none of the
							Company Parties makes any representation regarding the likelihood
							of appreciation of the NFTs or Artwork associated therewith nor
							any element thereof, and has no control whatsoever on the value of
							any NFT, including on any secondary markets, which are completely
							outside of the control of any of the foregoing parties.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are solely responsible for your compliance with applicable
							laws and regulations, including tax obligations in relation with
							any NFT and cryptocurrencies. Please be aware that changes in
							applicable laws and regulations may impact the Services and your
							rights and obligations regarding your NFT.
						</p>
						<p>
							By accessing and using the Site or the Services (including,
							without limitation, any related to the NFTs or any Utility), you
							represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated
							enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using
							cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a
							working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets
							such as Ethereum (ETH), and other digital tokens. In particular,
							you understand that blockchain-based transactions are
							irreversible. You further understand that the markets for these
							digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but
							not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and
							regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of
							transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, such
							as Ethereum, are variable and may increase dramatically at any
							time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your
							digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are
							supplied through or in connection with the Site, you may suffer
							loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair
							or liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes, experience
							significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone
							can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and
							tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge
							and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other
							tokens. You further acknowledge that Company is not responsible

						<p>
							15. <u>Disputes and Arbitration Agreement</u>
							<br />
							CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ("
							<strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</strong>"). IT REQUIRES YOU TO
							ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COMPANY OR ANY OF THE COMPANY PARTIES AND
							LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY OR ANY
							OF THE COMPANY PARTIES. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO
							RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, WHICH
							MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE THE DISPUTE DECIDED BY A
							JUDGE OR JURY, AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN
							COLLECTIVE ACTION, WHETHER THAT BE A CLASS ACTION, CLASS
							ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO
							OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE BY SENDING US NOTICE OF YOUR
							INTENT TO DO SO WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR INITIAL AGREEMENT
							TO THESE TERMS.
						</p>
						<p>
							Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith
							Negotiations. Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us
							of any kind, including an arbitration as set forth below, you and
							we agree that we will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or
							controversy between us arising out of or relating to these Terms,
							the NFTs, or the Services by engaging in good faith negotiations.
							Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the
							aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party
							specifying the nature and details of the dispute. The party
							receiving such notice shall have (30) days to respond to the
							notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the
							initial notice, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith by
							videoconference or by telephone to try to resolve the dispute. If
							the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within ninety (90)
							days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the
							parties may agree to mediate their dispute, or either party may
							submit the dispute to arbitration as set forth below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute
							or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to
							any Services sold, made available, or distributed through or in
							connection with the Site, or the NFTs, or to any aspect of your
							relationship with Company will be resolved by binding arbitration,
							rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in
							small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) Company may
							seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of
							intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress,
							domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
						</p>
						<p>
							Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs
							the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
							To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
							requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at Core
							Memories, LLC, Legal Department, 8 The Green, STE B, Dover,
							Delaware, 19901. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
							established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
							involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive
							of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most
							current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
							procedures available at
							http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other
							claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
							Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
							http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s
							rules are also available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at
							800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties
							will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds
							that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative,
							hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS,
							Company shall have the option, exercisable in its sole discretion,
							to pay them for you. You may choose to have the arbitration
							conducted by telephone or video conference or based on written
							submissions, or you may request to meet in-person for arbitration
							in Los Angeles, California. You agree that any judgment on the
							award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
							competent jurisdiction. Payment of all filing, administration, and
							arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules, including
							rules regarding frivolous or improper claims. The prevailing party
							will be entitled to an award of their reasonable attorney’s fees
							and costs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive
							authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this
							Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the
							interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
							Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that
							all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
							The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
							you and Company. The arbitration proceeding will not be
							consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
							or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
							monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
							available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral
							forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration
							Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
							statement of decision describing the essential findings and
							conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
							of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to
							award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law
							would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
							you and Company. And you agree that to the extent monetary or
							non-monetary remedy or relief is granted, such request for relief
							may be enforced as needed by any court of competent jurisdiction.
						</p>
						<p>
							Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY
							CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
							TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Company are instead
							electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
							arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as otherwise
							indicated in this Section 15. An arbitrator can award on an
							individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must
							follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there
							is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
							arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
						</p>
						<p>
							Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.{' '}
							<strong>
								ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
								AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
								OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE,
								AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER, HOLDER OR USER CANNOT BE
								ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER,
								HOLDER OR USER. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
								PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT,
								INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY
								SUCH DISPUTE.
							</strong>{' '}
							If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes
							enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a
							given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the
							arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in
							the State of California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
						</p>
						<p>
							30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the
							provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice
							of your decision to opt out to the following address: Core
							Memories, LLC, Legal Department, 8 The Green, STE B, Dover,
							Delaware, 19901, within 30 days after first becoming subject to
							this Arbitration Agreement. You may also submit your decision to
							signupgenxnfts@gmail.com. Your notice must include your name and
							address, the Digital Wallet address you used to transact on this
							Site (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want
							to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this
							Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will
							continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement
							has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may
							currently have, or may enter in the future, with Company.
						</p>
						<p>
							16. <u>Severability.</u>
							<br />
							If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal
							or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of
							the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
							impaired thereby and any such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
							provision shall be reformed to the limited extent necessary so as
							to reflect the intentions of the parties as closely as possible,
							in accordance with applicable law.
						</p>
						<p>
							17. <u>Assignment</u>. Company may transfer all or part of its
							rights and obligations under these Terms to any person, entity,
							affiliate, subsidiary, parent, or third-party, including, but not
							limited to, in case of merger, division, partial asset transfer or
							full or partial business disposal. You shall not transfer all or
							part of your obligations under these Terms, in any way whatsoever,
							without the express prior written agreement of Company. These
							Terms will transfer and be binding upon and will inure to the
							benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
						</p>
						<p>
							18. <u>Modification.</u> Notwithstanding any provision in these
							Terms to the contrary, Company agrees that if Company makes any
							future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may
							reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming
							effective by writing to Company at the following address: Core
							Memories, LLC, Legal Department, 8 The Green, STE B, Dover,
							Delaware, 19901.
						</p>
						<p>
							19. <u>Disputes Between Owners; Blockchain Issues</u>
							<br />
							Company has no obligation to support the resolution of, or resolve
							any, dispute that may arise between or involve any NFT owners.
							Because virtually all public blockchains are licensed under open
							source licenses, it is possible that the blockchain may fork,
							merge, or duplicate the original blockchain that initially
							recorded ownership of your NFT. In such case, any rights granted
							to you under these Terms will be granted only to the lawful owners
							of such NFT whose ownership is recorded on the mainnet version of
							the blockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly
							supported in the blockchain industry as the legitimate successor
							of the original blockchain (as determined in our sole discretion).
							Any rights purportedly granted hereunder to the owner of a NFT
							recorded on any other blockchain is void ab initio.
						</p>
						<p>
							20. <u>Entire Agreement</u>
							<br />
							These Terms comprise the entire agreement between you and Company
							relating to your access to and use of the Services (including,
							without limitation, any Utility) and any NFTs at any time, and
							supersede any and all prior discussions agreements, and
							understandings of any kind. Except as otherwise provided herein,
							these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and
							are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any
							other person or entity.
						</p>
						<p>
							21. <u>Miscellaneous</u>
							<br />
							Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to create, or be
							construed as creating, a joint venture or partnership between the
							parties. Neither party is, by virtue of these Terms or otherwise,
							authorized as an agent or legal representative of the other party.
							Neither party is granted any right or authority to assume or to
							create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on
							behalf or in the name of the other party. Nothing contained in
							these Terms will be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary
							right upon any third party whatsoever. You and each Owner shall
							execute and deliver to Company any and all such other instruments
							in reasonable mutually acceptable form and substance and shall
							take any and all such other actions as Company shall deem
							reasonably necessary to carry the intent of these Terms into full
							force and effect. Neither party will be afforded or denied
							preference in the construction of these Terms, whether by virtue
							of being the drafter or otherwise. The headings to sections of
							these Terms are for convenience or reference only and do not form
							a part of these Terms and will not in any way affect its
							interpretation.
